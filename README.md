**_Overview and Origin_**

Rocket mortgage was founded in 1985 by Dan Gilbert with its headquarters in Detroit, Michigan.Back then it was known as Rock Financial and focused on mortgage brokerage. In 1988, the company transitioned to become a mortgage lender and eventually changed it's name to Rocket Mortgage in 2021. As the world continued to evolve, he saw an opportunity with the rise of the internet and in 1998 he commited all company resources to moving online and took the company public under the symbol RCCK. one year later, Intuit Inc which was primarily a tax software purchased the company and renamed it Quiken loans. in 2002, Quicken loans was able to facilitate a mortgage application online from start to finish.Shortly thereafter, Dan Gilbert got together with a couple of private investors and purchased back the company and retained it as ishe company proceeded to grow and was able to dodge the 2008 market fiasco by not originating sub-prime mortgages. 

Rocket Mortggage saw a need for a system that could streamline the already complex mortgage application process while reaching a wider customer base. This customer base would also include applicants who would generally be denied mortgages by local banks. With the introduction of their website and phone application, one can now apply for a mortgage at the click of a button. The company has closed more than $1.6 trillion home loans since it's inception.
